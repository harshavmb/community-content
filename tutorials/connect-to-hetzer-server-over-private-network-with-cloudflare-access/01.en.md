## Introduction

In today's fast-paced digital world, security and accessibility are two critical concerns for businesses and individuals alike. With the increasing number of cyber threats and the need for remote access to servers, it's essential to establish secure connections to your servers while maintaining ease of access. This blog will guide you through the process of connecting to a Hetzner server over a private network using Cloudflare Access, a powerful tool that combines security and convenience.

## Why Private Network Access?

An excerpt from `/var/log/auth.log` of my server exposed to public internet.

```bash
hetzneruser@hetzner-vm:~$ sudo grep -R "Failed password for root from" /var/log/auth.log  | wc -l
24780
```

These failures are recorded in a span of few hours I provisioned a VM. This tells there are bad actors out there on internet trying to break into your network with a big list of random passwords. Most of them could have been leaked in one of the previous data breaches.

Traditionally, server access has relied on the public internet, which poses security risks such as unauthorized access, data breaches, and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. Private networks, on the other hand, provide a more secure environment by restricting access to authorized users only.

## Differences wrt., a traditional VPN

* **Security**: Cloudflare Access is a zero trust platform, which means that it only grants access to users who have been authenticated and authorized. This is in contrast to a traditional VPN, which simply tunnels all traffic between the user and the corporate network, regardless of the user's identity or authorization. The same applies to the application you access over a private network rather accessing various applications on a subnet with traditional VPN.
* **Performance**: Cloudflare Access is designed to be lightweight and have minimal impact on performance. This is because it does not require users to install any software or change their routing tables. In contrast, a traditional VPN can add latency and reduce bandwidth, especially for users who are connecting from a remote location.
* **Scalability**: Cloudflare Access is a cloud-based service, which means that it is scalable to meet the needs of any organization. This is in contrast to a traditional VPN, which may require the organization to purchase and manage its own hardware and software.
* **Ease of use**: Cloudflare Access is easy to set up and manage. It can be integrated with existing identity providers, such as Okta, Azure Active Directory and many others. In contrast, a traditional VPN can be more complex to set up and manage, especially for large organizations.

Here is a table summarizing the key differences between Cloudflare Access and a traditional VPN:

| Feature       | Cloudflare Access            | Traditional VPN                        |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Security      | Zero trust                   | Tunnels all traffic                    |
| Performance   | Minimal impact               | Can add latency and reduce bandwidth   |
| Scalability   | Cloud-based                  | On-premises                            |
| Ease of use   | Easy to set up and manage    | Can be complex to set up and manage    |

-----------

**Prerequisites**

Before we dive into the deployment process, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. **Cloudflare account**: You should have an account with Cloudflare. If you don't have yet, you could create one [here](https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/products/access/). Cloudflare offers many services as part of their free tier. [Cloudflare Access](https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/products/access/) is also one such offering.

2. **Server**: A  server or Linux virtual machine. If you haven't already, sign up for a Hetzner Cloud account. Once you're logged in, create a virtual machine (VM) or choose an existing server you want to secure with Cloudflare Access.

3. **Warp Client**: You need to have a warp client installed on your local machine. You can download the client for your operating system from official Cloudflare portal [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/download-warp/).

## Step 1 - Creating the Tunnel in Cloudflare dashboard

Cloudflare Tunnel provides you with a secure way to connect your resources to Cloudflare without a publicly routable IP address. With Tunnel, you do not send traffic to an external IP — instead, a lightweight daemon in your infrastructure (`cloudflared`) creates outbound-only connections to Cloudflare’s global network. Cloudflare Tunnel can connect HTTP web servers, [SSH servers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/use-cases/ssh/), [remote desktops](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/use-cases/rdp/), and other protocols safely to Cloudflare. This way, your origins can serve traffic through Cloudflare without being vulnerable to attacks that bypass Cloudflare.
![cloudflare tunnel Flow diagram](images/cloudflare-tunnel-flow.png)

### Step 1.1 - Create a tunnel
You can create a tunnel by name of your choice as shown below.
![cloudflare tunnel](images/create-tunnel.png)

### Step 1.2 - Choosing environment for cloudflared
When you choose a name & hit `Save`, you will see few options of `Choose your environment`. Here you need to select OS flavors & CPU architecture. 
Based on these attributes, `Cloudflare` constructs the install commands accordingly which can be run directly on the target host. Below screenshot is for Debian arm64 variant.
![Debian ARM64 variant](images/cloudflared-connector.png)

### Step 1.3 - Setting up Private Network
In the next phase, you will see other options such as `Public Hostname` & `Private Network`. As this demo is about accessing private services over internet via Cloudflare access, we leave `Public Hostname` as is & focus more on `Private Network`. Here we would need to input the CIDR of private network where the VM is present. An example is shown below.
![Private Network](images/private-network.png)
----------------

## Step 2 - Installing & configuring cloudflared
Now that we have generated installation & configuration commands required for our host to connect to cloudflare tunnel, we will start executing the commands generated in above step. 

Make sure the SSH support setting for your host is enabled if it's linux.

### Step 2.1 - Executing commands

```bash
hetzneruser@hetzner-vm:~$ curl -L --output cloudflared.deb https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-linux-amd64.deb && 
> 
> sudo dpkg -i cloudflared.deb &&

> **Note:** In above screenshots and bash commands, there is a token at the end of `sudo cloudflared service install` command which must be kept as a secret. It's in plain text here just for the sake of demo.

### Step 2.2 - Verifying the cloudflared service on target host

You could verify whether the `cloudflared` service is running by running `systemctl status cloudflared` command.

```bash
hetzneruser@hetzner-vm:~$ systemctl status cloudflared
● cloudflared.service - cloudflared
     Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/cloudflared.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)

```

### Step 2.3 - Check the agent health on Cloudflare dashboard

Now that the cloudflared daemon is running, we verify whether agent is connected to cloudflared edge network. It is shown in the same `Tunnels` tab.
![agent-health](images/agent-health.png). 

If you have a firewall in the path filtering outbound traffic you may need to whitelist cloudflared URLS over `https` protocol for the agent to establish communication with cloudflare edge network.

### Step 2.4 - Install nginx (optional)

For the sake of demo, we install nginx web server. By default it runs on port 80 which would be a good test for us to connect to the webserver over private network.

```bash
hetzneruser@hetzner-vm:~$ sudo apt install nginx

```

## Step 3 - Setting up warp client

The Cloudflare WARP client allows you to protect corporate devices by securely and privately sending traffic from those devices to Cloudflare’s global network, where Cloudflare Gateway can apply advanced web filtering. The WARP client also makes it possible to apply advanced Zero Trust policies that check for a device’s health before it connects to corporate applications.

In simple terms, it is analogous to a VPN client.

### Step 3.1 - Install the client

As said earlier, you can download & install the client for your operating system from official Cloudflare portal [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/download-warp/). In this demo I'm using MacOS.

### Step 3.2 - Login to your Cloudflare Zero Trust

If you click on `Warp` app & then another click on `Settings` icon, you see `Preferences`. Once you click on `Preferences`, you see `Account` tab. In there, you see `Login to Cloudflare Zero trust` button as shown in below screenshot
![Login to Cloudflare Zero trust](images/register-warp.png)

### Step 3.3 - Authenticating with Cloudflare Access

When you click on `Login to Cloudflare Zero trust` button, a popup arrives asking you to enter your Cloudflare team name. When you pass the Team name you created on Cloudflare dashboard, you will be redirected to Cloudflare dashboard to challenge the authentication. If the authentication challenge is successful, your `WARP` client is connected to Cloudflare Edge & all is well.
![Authenticating with Cloudflare Access](images/login-to-cloudflare-team.png)

### Step 3.4 - Verifying the Warp device on Cloudflare dashboard

The moment WARP devices are connected to Cloudflare Edge, we must see them on Cloudflare dashboard as shown below:
![Warp Devices on Cloudflare dashboard](images/warp-devices-on-cloudflare.png)

### Step 3.5 - Connect to the target host over private IP

#### Test SSH
Now it's time to test our configuration! As part of this demo, we whitelisted the entire subnet, so we must be able to carry out lot of checks. First, we start with `SSH`.
```bash
ABC-MBP:Projects hello$ ssh hetzneruser@10.0.0.2
Welcome to Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.15.0-79-generic aarch64)

Last login: Wed Aug 23 06:12:45 2023 from 10.0.0.2
hetzneruser@hetzner-vm:~$ 
```
#### Test ping
In the next phase, we use `ping` as shown below:
```bash
Hello-MBP:Projects hello$ ping 10.0.0.2
PING 10.0.0.2 (10.0.0.2): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 10.0.0.2: icmp_seq=0 ttl=253 time=248.381 ms
64 bytes from 10.0.0.2: icmp_seq=1 ttl=253 time=30.464 ms
64 bytes from 10.0.0.2: icmp_seq=2 ttl=253 time=30.477 ms
64 bytes from 10.0.0.2: icmp_seq=3 ttl=253 time=29.127 ms

--- 10.0.0.2 ping statistics ---
4 packets transmitted, 4 packets received, 0.0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 29.127/84.612/248.381/94.554 ms
```
#### Test nginx
Another test would be to install a webserver like `nginx` & try to access it from `WARP` client browser as shown below:
![Access nginx privately](images/![SSH port disabled](images/hetzner-firewall.png).png)

So, we tested `ssh`, `icmp` & `http` protocols & all worked as expected. If you want you can test `udp` protocols as well but it's not enabled by default. So, you would need to enable it on `Cloudflare Access` dashboard.

### Step 3.6 - Additional checks (Optional & only when one of 3.5 steps fail)

In case if one of the tests in Step 3.5 fail, you need to do below checks.

#### Check private network exclusion
Verify your private network is not excluded locally by `warp`. Certain private IP networks are locally excluded so that they don't interfer with your local home network. Nevertheless, you can override such networks & force them to go via `Cloudflare Tunnel`. In below screenshot, `192.168.0.0/16` CIDR is excluded. Default `warp` configuration also overrides `10.0.0.0/8` CIDR too. If your private network falls in one of the above CIDRs you might need to remove that exclusion.
![Exclude Local IP CIDR](images/exclude-local-ip-cidr.png)

#### Check protocol exclusion
Only TCP protocol is tunneled by default. `icmp` & `udp` will fail unless it's enabled on the portal as shown below.
![Cloudflare Traffic Protocol](images/cloudflare-traffic-protocols.png)

The above checks aren't exhaustive but listed above with an intention that it would help viewers from spending lot of time investigating why tunneling isn't working as desired. 

### Step 4 - Tightening Hetzner Firewall rules

Now that we have successfully connected to our Hetzner VM over private network, we can disable ports we don't need on Firewall. In below screenshot I'm disabling `SSH(22)` port.
![SSH port disabled](images/hetzner-firewall.png)

## Conclusion

Securing your Hetzner server with Cloudflare Access over a private network is a wise investment in your server's security and accessibility. By implementing a Zero Trust approach, you can ensure that only authorized users can access your server resources, all while benefiting from Cloudflare's performance and reliability. Give it a try and enjoy the peace of mind that comes with a robust security solution like Cloudflare Access.
